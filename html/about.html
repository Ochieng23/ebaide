      <h2 style="text-align: center;">About me</h2>
      <p >
        Hi. My name is Ebaide. On the 15th of October, 2021, I left my country,
        Nigeria, to tour 5 countries in East Africa. I planned to spend one
        month in each country, and decided to start in Rwanda. I flew into
        Nairobi Kenya on the 15th of November with an already-purchased flight
        ticket to Tanzania for the 13th of December. Well, guess what? I never
        left Kenya until the 6th of March, 2022. That day, I left Nairobi for
        Kampala, spent only 5 days there, and traveled back to Nigeria. I spent
        2 months selling all my things and putting things in order. In May 2021,
        I left Nigeria with a luggage containing everything I had in the world.

      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Before Van Life</h2>
      <p>
        I became fully independent at 17. Since then, I’ve worked many jobs to
        see myself through school, and be the best in every endeavor I took. My
        every day quest was to earn more money, get the next promotion, the next
        bigger gig. I would say I wasn’t doing bad in Lagos. I worked hard
        enough to afford to buy a nice car, to shoot films for my production
        company, wear some designer shoes, tour some countries, and live just a
        tad above average in the Nigerian economy. Sometimes, I spent up to 14
        hours working, other times, I spent 10. My highly competitive spirit
        made it easy to put in the extra hours I needed to be the best in every
        where I worked. I was the type who would sleep while working and wake up
        into it. But then, that was never enough for me. I simply wasn’t
        contented living my life on pre-plans, on routines. Having life pass me
        by while living it conventionally and safely made me miserable. I wanted
        more. I always had this deep-set unsettling feeling because I knew there
        was more out there for me. I knew I’d rather be cramped up on a tiny bed
        in a $7 hotel than a 5-star hotel. I wanted to get my shoes dirty while
        hiking or spend 20 straight hours sitting on a bus from country A to B.

        They said the grass isn’t always greener on the other side. For me, I
        tested the waters enough to know that the grass is definitely greener
        for the alternative lifestyle I earnestly craved. I moved to Kenya for
        greener pastures, to have my basic needs sorted so I could have the time
        and the mental stability to pursue things that would improve my life. I
        moved to Nairobi, and rented a beautiful apartment on the 6th floor of a
        high-rise building. My happiness in that house lasted for only 3 months.
        I started feeling uncomfortable with having to pay my rent every 30
        days. You see, we pay yearly in Nigeria, and I was used to that. Not
        only were Nairobi apartments thrice more expensive that Lagos, I had two
        part with money for rent 12 times in a year. Traveling around Kenya
        became hard as I had to pay for an Airbnb or hotel while travelling and
        still had to keep paying for my apartment in Nairobi. Traveling stopped
        being nearly as much fun as it was because it meant that I had to pay
        for two apartments at the same time. I couldn’t help feeling that my
        life would be much better if I spent that money making memories on the
        road.

      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Van Life Story</h2>
      <p>
        I stumbled upon van life about 5 years ago on YouTube. I conceived the
        idea of doing it, but never took it seriously because I always knew I
        wouldn’t be able to do it in my country, Nigeria. No way would I have
        felt safe enough. During the pandemic, I watched so many van life vlogs
        that I started living the van life dream in my dreams! I conceived the
        idea of buying a Kombi, converting it to suit my lifestyle and driving
        to beaches wearing the sexiest bikinis. Problem was, I knew it wouldn’t
        happen any time soon because I lived in a country that wouldn’t have
        been safe enough for a solo female traveler living in a van on the
        streets. One month after I moved to kenya, I went solo camping in a
        place called Paradise Lost in Kiambu road, Nairobi. I was alone in the
        forest over the night. The sound of the forest left me petrified all
        night, but the next day, I felt so safe that I didn’t want to leave.
        That was when I knew Van life could be something I’ll enjoy doing in
        Kenya. It had always been someday, I’d live an alternative lifestyle.
        Someday, I’ll hit the road full-time. Someday, I’ll build a home on
        wheels from scratch. Someday, I’ll own a home that’d take me to the
        wildest of places. By the end of June, I’d had so many sleepless nights
        that I decided MY SOMEDAY WAS GOING TO BE RIGHT NOW. It took me a while
        to get the right van as it was a spontaneous decision. I needed a shell
        van with a great engine, something I could easily tear down and build
        into my desired tiny home. On the 17th of September, 2022, I bought my
        1987 Nissan Vannette. We bought it at Narok and drove it to Nairobi,
        kenya. We spent three months building. The full build is on YouTube
        YouTubehttps://m.youtube.com › playlistVAN BUILD SERIES Through 2022’s
        festive period, I was selling the things in my house one after the
        other. On the 4th of January, 2023, I moved into Daddy, the van with the
        things I hadn’t sold. On the 5th of January, 2023, we took a 7-hour trip
        from Nairobi to Meru where I started my van life journey.
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: center;">My plans</h2>
      <p>
        I could write several articles detailing how excellent van life is, how
        this is the best decision I’ve ever made, how you should sell your
        things and move into a moving vehicle, how it would be the highlight of
        your life, but… I WON’T. Instead, I want you to live vicariously through
        the tribulations, excitement, pain, conquests and highlights I’d
        experience while living on the road. I want you to feel the joy I feel
        from finding the most beautiful places and feel my pain when my van
        breaks down at the times adventures go wrong. I want you to see what it
        truly feels like to live in a vehicle. I want to share the laughter and
        tears with you. I believe that’s the only way you can truly get a feel
        of what Van Life truly is. THERE’D BE ZERO Inspirational blogs Boring
        lists Glitz and glamour *Inspirational bullshit irks me: I’m not the
        next blogger to tell you how my life is perfect after I sold everything
        and started traveling the world with a backpack and $20 in my pocket.
        No, $20 covers nothing. Traveling is expensive. If you don’t have some
        money saved or a sustainable job on the road, stay in your house. DO NOT
        get on the road. It’s a rewarding but hard life. If you believe that
        crap about leaving the life you know behind with no plans or money, YOU
        WILL SUFFER. *No boring lists: I don’t do perfect traveling. I want to
        experience the frustrations, the highs and lows. I want to experience it
        ALL. I won’t be the 954th blogger to tell you the best places to visit
        in Kenya. I won’t spam you with blogs about places that already saturate
        the Internet. Most of the lists I will be making are of things a solo
        female loner does while living and traveling in her van. *Zero Glitz &
        Glamour: I don’t do makeup. I don’t make frequent salon visits. I won’t
        make blogs about the fanciest hotels and the most expensive tourist
        sites. I am a mess who sits on the floor of her van and has been
        carrying the same old backpack every day since 2021. I’ll take you to
        the roughest places, do a lot of bush crafting, meet tribes and people.
        Social media is full of people putting more importance to superficial
        things and never finding the time to actually enjoy moments. People care
        more about what they’re wearing and their made-up face than than truly
        experiencing moments that leave everlasting imprints in their lives

      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Ebaide Today</h2>
      <p>
        At the time of opening this website and writing this blog, I am in Meru,
        kenya. I am starting my van life journey here because it is slower than
        Nairobi. I thought it would be easier for me to get into this lifestyle
        here than in a fast place. So far, I really enjoy living in my space.
        Daddy, the van is MINE. It is MY thing, MY own. I have never felt freer
        than this. I am still at the teething stage, but I’m sure time will help
        blend me more into this lifestyle. My YouTube channel will always be
        busy with new videos. This blog will always have new stories about a
        Nigerian girl living in a small van away from her home country.
